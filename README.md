#jlp_spmeas
Program 1. to automatically measure a series of autocorelation FITS files of binary stars or 2. to compute zero theta from a series of long exposures of star tracks (that are obtained when stopping the r.a. tracking motor).
(Automatic measures are designed to be used for files created by PiscoSpeck1 but can be also be used for other autocorrelation FITS files.)
